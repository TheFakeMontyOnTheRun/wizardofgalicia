# The Wizard of Galicia
The Wizard of Galicia is a dungeon crawler in the spirit of Orcs and Elves, but done in the style of Catacomb 3D. Has a optional text mode.

Planned: a SDL1 version, a text mode version, a Android and a modern-looking Cardboard VR version.

This is heavily based on the WIP Knights-In-Porto codebase, for the #LOWREZJAM 2016.
